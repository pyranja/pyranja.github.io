I am a software engineer passionate about clean code and continuous improvement. My main interests are modern Java development, service oriented architectures and data integration.

I studied business informatics at the University of Vienna. During my studies I worked as a research assistent at the [Research Group Scientific Computing]. There I was part of the European [VPH-Share] project.

In my free time I enjoy reading, skiing, running and having a good time with my friends in Vienna.
