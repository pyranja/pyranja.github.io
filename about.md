I am pursuing by masters degree in computer sciences at the University of Vienna, Austria. I am also working there as a software developer at the [Research Group Scientific Computing], where I am part of the european [VPH-Share] project. My main interests are modern Java development, micro-services and data integration.

In my free time I enjoy reading, skiing, running and having a good time with my friends.
